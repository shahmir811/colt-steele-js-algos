## Usage

Install dependencies.
Go inside **exercies** folder and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Or

```bash
npm install -g jest
```

## Testing

For testing your code, go inside **exercies** folder and run following command:

```bash
npm install test problem/test
```

For real time testing, run the following command inside **exercies** folder:

```bash
jest problem/test --watch
```
